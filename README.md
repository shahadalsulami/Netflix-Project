# Netflix Project

## Introduction:
This project analyzes datasets about Netflix content, including titles, genres, actors, and release years. The goal is to uncover trends and patterns in streaming content to better understand Netflixâ€™s offerings.

## Requirements:
- **os:** for creating directories and manage file paths
- **shutil:** for copying files
- **pandas:** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy:** for performing numerical and mathematical operations.
- **matplotlib:** for creating visualizations and plots.
- **seaborn:**  for advanced visualizations
- **ast(literal_eval):** for parsing string-formatted lists/dictionaries safely

## Project Files:
- **Data_Wrangling_Project_Starter (2).html:** This HTML file is the converted version of the Jupyter notebook
- **Data_Wrangling_Project_Starter.ipynb:** The Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis
- **README.md:** This file that explains the project
- **kaggle.json:** Kaggle API credentials file, used for dataset access
  
## What I learned:
- **Statistical Analysis:** practiced basic stats like calculating the mean to get insights from data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** gained experience cleaning data, handling missing values, and structuring data for analysis.
- **Visualization:** learned to create clear charts and graphs with matplotlib and seaborn to effectively communicate results.
- **File Handling:** used os and shutil libraries to manage files and folders for data setup.
- **Data Parsing:** applied ast.literal_eval to safely convert string data into usable Python objects.
